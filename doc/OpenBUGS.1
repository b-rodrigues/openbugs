.SH DESCRIPTION

Invoke OpenBUGS, usually specifying a script and performing template
expansion inside the script file to specifiy directory paths.

Names inside of curly brackets in a script file are interpreted as
environmental variables and the values of the environmental variables
are substituted.  The environmental variables can be set temporarily
on the same command line as OpenBUGS execution using the env function,
or on a separate line or in a default startup file.

Note: the OpenBUGS script command 'modelSetWD('path')' can now be used
as an easier way to set the path where OpenBUGS looks for model, data
and initial value files.  The environment variable mechanism is still
available however, for backward compatibility.
