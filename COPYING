DEVELOPMENT
-----------

The source code for the OpenBUGS shared library libOpenBUGS.so is
provided in the Windows package for OpenBUGS, available for download from 

http://www.openbugs.info

The source is written in the Blackbox Component Pascal language, and
provided as Blackbox compound document (.odc) files.  These can be
opened in the Windows version of OpenBUGS, but to compile them the
Blackbox development environment is required, available from 

http://oberon.ch/blackbox.html

Blackbox is only available for Windows, and no Linux development tools
exist.  The Linux shared library is cross-compiled on Windows.  For
further information about developing OpenBUGS, see the files in the
Developer subdirectory of the Windows installation.

See each individual source file (.odc) for an exact license statement.
