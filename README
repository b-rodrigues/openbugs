OpenBUGS is a software package for performing Bayesian analysis and
simulation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.



INSTALLATION
------------ 

To install OpenBUGS on a standard Linux system : 

./configure
make
sudo make install 

The "sudo" is included since "make install" requires root
(administrative) privileges by default.  If you don't have
administrative access, you can get around this by installing in a
location other than /usr/local, for example /home/chris/usr :

./configure --prefix=/home/chris/usr 
make
make install 



DOCUMENTATION 
-------------

The full documentation for the OpenBUGS modelling language is
installed as HTML, by default in

/usr/local/lib/OpenBUGS/doc/Manuals/Contents.html

For help on invoking the Linux command-line program,  see 

man OpenBUGS 

For further information about OpenBUGS, see http://openbugs.info



DEVELOPMENT
-----------

For information on development with the OpenBUGS source code, see
the OpenBUGS Developer Manual, installed by default in 

/usr/local/lib/OpenBUGS/doc/Developer/Manual.html

The source code for the OpenBUGS shared library libOpenBUGS.so is
provided in the Windows package for OpenBUGS, available for download from 

http://www.openbugs.net

The source is written in the Blackbox Component Pascal language, and
provided as Blackbox compound document (.odc) files.  These can be
opened in the Windows version of OpenBUGS, but to compile them the
Blackbox development environment is required, available from 

http://oberon.ch/blackbox.html

Blackbox is only available for Windows, and no Linux development tools
exist.  The ELF format shared library used by the Linux version of
OpenBUGS is compiled and linked on Windows.
